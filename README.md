# authorizedkeys

## Foreword
This is fork of [dockercloud/dockercloud-authorizedkeys](https://github.com/docker/dockercloud-authorizedkeys)
This image purges all already existing keys upon running.

[![Deploy to Docker Cloud](https://files.cloud.docker.com/images/deploy-to-dockercloud.svg)](https://cloud.docker.com/stack/deploy/)

Adds a user public SSH key to the host's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` using a container

## Usage

    docker run -v /root:/user -e AUTHORIZED_KEYS="`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`" dockercloud/authorizedkeys

With multiple keys:

	docker run -v /root:/user -e AUTHORIZED_KEYS="`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa1.pub`,`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa2.pub`" dockercloud/authorizedkeys

Adding the key to a user different than `root`:

	docker run -v /home/myuser:/user -e AUTHORIZED_KEYS="`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`" dockercloud/authorizedkeys


## Usage in Docker Cloud

	authorizedkeys:
	  image: dockercloud/authorizedkeys
	  deployment_strategy: every_node
	  autodestroy: always
	  environment:
	    - AUTHORIZED_KEYS=ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1y....
